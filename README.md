# image-matrix
Python script for cutting images out of image matrix
Requirements :
- Install python 2.x or 3.x
- Install Opencv 'pip install opencv-python'

Steps :

- Run cmd or terminal
- cd /path/to/folder
- Run script 'python script <Image_name>' eg. 'python script Player.png'
- Checkout Folder <Image_name>

###
Note for very small images like Player.png the edges are overlapped which results in some unexpected results and lowering the edge size cause gaps between edges else logic is working fine.
